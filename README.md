# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict **customer churn** — identifying which customers are likely to stop using a service. Built during my internship at **Mentoga** via **Skilled Score**, this model helps businesses retain customers and reduce revenue loss by proactively identifying at-risk clients.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies customers as:
- ✅ **Active**
- ❌ **Churned**

This enables companies to make data-driven retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## 📊 Key Features

- Performs **data preprocessing** and feature encoding
- Trains multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Outputs key metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Generates visualizations (churn rate, feature importance)
- Includes confusion matrix and ROC-AUC analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

- Contains customer data with features like:
  - Tenure, Contract Type
  - Monthly Charges, Internet Service
  - Payment Method, Gender, and more
  - Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)
